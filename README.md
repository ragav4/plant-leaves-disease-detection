Overview:
Plant leaves disease detection involves identifying and diagnosing diseases affecting plants through their leaf patterns, colors, shapes, and textures. This is crucial for maintaining plant health and ensuring optimal agricultural productivity.

Techniques:
    Image Processing:
        Segmentation: Separating the leaf from the background for better analysis.
        Feature Extraction: Identifying key features like color, texture, and shape that indicate disease.
        Classification: Using machine learning models (e.g., SVM, KNN) or deep learning (e.g., CNNs) to classify the type of disease based on extracted features.
    Machine Learning & Deep Learning:
        Training Models: Large datasets of healthy and diseased leaf images are used to train models.
        Prediction: Models predict diseases on new leaf images by comparing them with learned patterns.
        
Common Diseases:
    Blight: Irregular, water-soaked spots.
    Mildew: White powdery substance on the leaf surface.
    Rust: Orange, yellow, or brown pustules.
    
Applications:
    Agriculture: Helping farmers identify and manage plant diseases early.
    Gardening: Assisting gardeners in maintaining healthy plants.
    Research: Advancing agricultural science and technology.
